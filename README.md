## Project Description
This is a full-stack web application for violence detection in videos using deep learning. The system combines a React/Vite frontend with a FastAPI backend to provide an intuitive interface for uploading videos and detecting violent content using a CNN-LSTM model.

## Features

### Web Application Features
- **User Authentication**: Secure registration and login system with JWT tokens
- **Video Upload**: Drag-and-drop or click-to-upload interface with video preview
- **Batch Upload Queue**: Upload and analyze multiple videos sequentially
- **Violence Detection**: AI-powered analysis using CNN-LSTM model
- **Results Dashboard**: Visualize detection results with confidence scores
- **History Tracking**: View and filter past analysis results
- **Export Reports**: Download history as CSV file
- **Share Results**: Copy detection results to clipboard or share via native share API
- **Profile Management**: Update profile information and change password
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-friendly interface with app-like experience
- **PWA Support**: Installable progressive web app with offline capabilities
- **Social Sharing**: Open Graph image for rich link previews on social media

### Technical Features
- **Modern Tech Stack**: React 18, Vite, Tailwind CSS, Framer Motion, Lucide Icons
- **Robust Backend**: FastAPI with SQLite database, JWT authentication
- **Deep Learning Model**: CNN-LSTM architecture for video violence detection
- **Secure Authentication**: Password hashing with bcrypt, token-based auth
- **RESTful API**: Well-documented endpoints for all functionality
- **Environment Configuration**: Configurable via environment variables
- **Production Ready**: Deployed on Render (backend) and Vercel (frontend)

## Model Architecture
The violence detection model uses a hybrid CNN-LSTM approach:
1.  **Frame Extraction**: Uniformly samples 10 frames from input video
2.  **Feature Extraction**: MobileNetV2 extracts spatial features from each frame
3.  **Temporal Analysis**: LSTM networks analyze sequential frame features
4.  **Classification**: Dense layers output violence probability score

## Performance
- **Accuracy**: Approximately **97%** violence detection accuracy
- **Processing Time**: Under 2 seconds per video (depending on length)
- **Model Size**: Optimized for efficient inference

## Deployment
The system is deployed using:
- **Backend**: Render.com (https://violence-detection-api-mhzo.onrender.com)
- **Frontend**: Vercel (https://violence-detection-system-using-cnn.vercel.app)

### Environment Variables
Backend requires:
- `SECRET_KEY`: JWT signing key
- `ALLOWED_ORIGINS`: Comma-separated list of allowed CORS origins
- `MODEL_PATH`: Path to model directory (optional)
- `MODEL_FILE`: Model filename (default: best_lstm_model_v3.keras)
- `TOKEN_EXPIRE_MINUTES`: JWT expiration time (default: 10080 = 7 days)
- `DB_PATH`: Database path (optional)
- `DB_NAME`: Database filename (default: users.db)

Frontend requires:
- `VITE_API_URL`: Backend API URL

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 16+ and npm
- Python 3.8+
- Git

### Backend Setup
1.  Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Theani7/Violence-Detection-System-using-CNN-LSTM-Models.git
    cd Violence-Detection-System-using-CNN-LSTM-Models/backend
    ```

2.  Install Python dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3.  Set environment variables (create `.env` file):
    ```bash
    SECRET_KEY=your-secret-key-here
    ALLOWED_ORIGINS=http://localhost:5173,http://localhost:3000
    MODEL_PATH=../Alert  # Adjust based on your model location
    ```

4.  Ensure the model file exists at the specified path:
    ```
    ../Alert/best_lstm_model_v3.keras
    ```

5.  Start the backend server:
    ```bash
    uvicorn main:app --reload
    ```
    The API will be available at http://localhost:8000

### Frontend Setup
1.  Navigate to the frontend directory:
    ```bash
    cd ../frontend
    ```

2.  Install Node.js dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  Set environment variables (create `.env` file):
    ```bash
    VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:8000
    ```

4.  Start the development server:
    ```bash
